GOV.UK consists of many separate applications. Publishing apps are used by users
in government to publish content. Frontend applications render content to end
users on GOV.UK. APIs perform services in between.

Applications are hosted on our infrastructure, which is
[configured using puppet][govuk-puppet]. They are deployed to the servers
[using capistrano scripts][govuk-app-deployment].
