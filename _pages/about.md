This site is an experiment in auto-generated docs for GOV.UK developers.

Goals:

- Collect all the documentation. Have as little as possible in.
- If possible, allow the documentation to be viewed without leaving this site.


It has:

- [A dashboard](index.html) is a categorised list of projects that make up GOV.UK. Its purpose is to provide developers a mental model of what things exist on GOV.UK. The list is generated with a YAML file in this repo. The descriptions are pulled from GitHub.
- [Guides](guides.html) are pulled from the [alphagov/styleguides repo](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides). They contain useful information and conventions.
- [Gems](gems.html) have the documentation for our most often used gems.
- [Apps](apps.html)
- [Content schemas](content-schemas.html)
- [Document types](document-types.html)
